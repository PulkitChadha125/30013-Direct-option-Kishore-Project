Removed 1st green or red candle logic:

For Direct NSE BSE Index options 

Green Candle Signal Pattern Check Logic :

Check next candles one by one to find below pattern signal candle:
- Candle is green
- High < prev candle’s High 
- Low < prev candle’s Low

Entry
- Mark signal candle high (say SCH)
- Entry = SCH + ( √(SCH) × 26.11% )

refer to tradesettingsfile for slpoints and targetpercent values

Exit
T1 = Entry Price(EP) + X % (13.06%).   Exit X lots
SL1 → SL1Points below Entry Price   Exit = All lots.

T2 = EP + X %         Exit= X lots.
SL2 → SL2Points below T1    Exit = All remaining lots

T3 = EP + X %        Exit= X lots.
SL3 → SL3Points below T2    Exit = All remaining lots


T4 = EP + X %     Exit= X lots.
SL4 → SL4Points below T3    Exit = All remaining lots


Partial exits only for target as per given lots number
Any SL will exit will all outstanding lots and all other Targets and SL gets disabled

Red Signal Candle Pattern Check Logic:

Check next candles one by one to find below signal pattern candle :
- Candle is red
- High > prev candle’s High 
- Low > prev candle’s Low

Entry
- Mark signal candle low (say SCH)
- Entry = SCH - ( √(SCH) × 26.11% )

Exit
T1 = Entry Price(EP) - T1Percent%.       Exit= X lots.
SL1 → SL1Points points above Entry Price. Exit = All lots.

T2 = EP - T2Percent %       Exit= X lots.
SL2 → SL2Points above T1   Exit = All remaining lots


T3 = EP - T3Percent %        Exit= X lots.
SL3 → SL3Points above T2   Exit = All remaining lots


T4 = EP -T4Percent %          Exit= X lots.
SL4 → SL4Points above T3    Exit = All remaining lots


Partial exits only for target as per given lots number
Any SL will exit will all outstanding lots and all other Targets and SL gets disabled

For 
Stock, Futures or commodity scrips calculation is as below

Entry:

Instead of squaroot calc

√(SCH), use cube root
Entry = SCH + (∛(SCH) × 26.11%)

Target:
T1 = Entry Price(EP) - Y%.       Exit= X lots.

If price less than 2000 = 1% target
If price 2001 - 5000 = 0.5% target
If price more than 5000 = 0.25% target
